                "Front-End Loading (FEL) is the foundation of any successful Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) project. It is a structured, phased approach to project planning that ensures feasibility, cost control, and risk mitigation before significant capital is invested. The FEL process is typically divided into three stages—FEL 1, FEL 2, and FEL 3—each with its own objectives and deliverables. Strong FEL execution leads to better decision-making, fewer design changes, and reduced cost overruns.",
