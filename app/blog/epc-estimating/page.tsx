                "Estimating in Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) is not just about predicting costs—it's about risk management, project feasibility, and financial control. A single miscalculation in the early stages of a project can lead to significant overruns, jeopardizing profitability and execution. From initial conceptual estimates to detailed cost breakdowns, the accuracy of estimates shapes decision-making, contract negotiations, and project viability.",

                "At the earliest stages of an EPC project, conceptual estimating helps determine whether a project is viable. This phase involves rough cost assessments based on historical data, industry benchmarks, and preliminary project scope. While not highly detailed, these estimates provide critical insights for:",

At this stage, estimators rely on process flow diagrams (PFDs), piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), equipment lists, and material take-offs (MTOs) to generate detailed cost projections.",
                "Key factors influencing detailed estimates include:",
                "• Material selection – the type of steel, piping, and instrumentation can significantly impact costs.",
